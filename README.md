# R3F Portals ([Link](https://r3f-portals.netlify.app))

An experimental project created using `npx create-vite` using `@react-three/fiber` (R3F) to play with `MeshPortalMaterial`. This project is a learning exercise for understanding the capabilities of R3F and how to integrate various components from `@react-three/drei` such as `MeshPortalMaterial`, `CameraControls`, `Environment`, and more.
