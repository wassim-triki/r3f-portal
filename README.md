# R3F Portals

An experimental project using `@react-three/fiber` (R3F) to play with `MeshPortalMaterial`. This project is a learning exercise for understanding the capabilities of R3F and how to integrate various components from `@react-three/drei` such as `MeshPortalMaterial`, `CameraControls`, `Environment`, and more.

## Features
- Integration with R3F and Drei components.
- Scene setup with dynamic lighting and environment.
- Mesh portal material effects with active state animation.
